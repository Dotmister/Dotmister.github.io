I'm Adam - a fourth (and final) year Computer Science student at the University of St Andrews. 

Since 2010 I've acquired knowledge in a huge range of technologies. My current interest is in the Kinect, and Computer Vision. C++. Take a look at my [Projects](/projects/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/Dotmister) page to get an overview of a few things I've worked on.

I'm graduating in 2016 and currently searching for a great company to work for! Send me an email for my full CV.
