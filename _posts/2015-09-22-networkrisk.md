Multiplayer Risk was a year-long project as part of a team. Nathan Blades, James Russel, Victor Andrei & I worked on this for our third-year project.

Our game was selected as the best in the year, and we won the 2015 Metaswitch Networks Software Engineering Project Prize.

After 136 turns, an AI has won. 

The game is also fully playable with other people over the internet! [Check it out on GitHub](https://github.com/adamncasey/MultiplayerRisk)
